# createStyles

All CeStyle components are built with [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) based css-in-js library.
We recommend using `createStyles` to create styles for the rest of your application
as it provides the most convenient way to utilize CeStyle theme, but it is not required
â€“ you can use any other styling tools and languages.

## Features

- As fast and lightweight as emotion: `createStyles` extends [@emotion/react](https://emotion.sh/docs/@emotion/react)
- Subscribes to your CeStyle theming context
- Supports all emotion features: automatic critical css extraction during server side rendering, lazy evaluation, dynamic theming, etc.
- Server side rendering support: Next.js, Gatsby or any other environment
- Fully featured TypeScript support

## Basic usage

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesBasics} />

## Pseudo-classes

You can add pseudo-classes the same way as in any css-preprocessor like Sass:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesPseudo} />

## Styles parameters

You can receive any amount of parameters as second argument of `createStyles` function,
latter you will need to pass those parameters as argument to `useStyles` hook:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesParameters} />

## Composition and nested selectors

Since `createStyles` produces scoped class names you will need to create a reference to selector
in order to get static selector. `createStyles` receives `getRef` function to handle static selector creation:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesComposition} />

## Classes merging (cx function)

To merge class names use `cx` function, it has the same api as [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) package.

**!important:** Do not use external libraries like [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
or [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) with class names created with `createStyles` function
as it will produce styles collisions.

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesCx} />

## Media queries

You can use nested media queries like in Sass. Within query body you can use `theme.breakpoints`
defined via [CeStyleProvider](/theming/extend-theme/#breakpoints) or just static values:

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesMedia} />

## Keyframes

<Demo data={CreateStylesDemos.createStylesKeyframes} />

## Inline styles

Most of CeStyle components support [Styles API](/theming/styles-api/).
You can override default component styles inline or using [CeStyleProvider](/theming/cestyle-provider/)
the same way as with `createStyles`:

<Demo data={TabsDemos.stylesApi} />

## Using createStyles without @cestyle/core

You can use `createStyles` and `CeStyleProvider` without any other CeStyle packages:

```bash
yarn add @cestyle/styles

npm install @cestyle/styles
```

After installation you can import `createStyles` and other function from `@cestyle/styles` instead of `@cestyle/core` and use it separately:

```tsx
import { createStyles, CeStyleProvider, useCeStyleTheme } from '@cestyle/styles';
```

## Can I use other css-in-js libraries or SCSS with CeStyle?

Yes, you can. But please note that CeStyle already uses [emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and you may
have styles collisions and would have to overwrite styles with `!important`. Please consider
choosing `createStyle` before picking other libraries.
